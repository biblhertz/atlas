# Atlas of Gesture

This repo is based on a combination of two projects:
- Yale DHLab's PixPlot: https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot
- CMU Perceptual Computing Lab's OpenPose: https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose 


The combination was made by Leonardo Impett (Bibliotheca Hertziana), for a project with Peter Bell (FAU) on the gestural temporality of Annunciation images.
